## My Assumptions
- User can be authorized based on Pass Key which is a combination of his/her email and 4 digit random number and it is unique for all users.
- User need to pay Rs 500 as a registration fee.

## My Approach
- User have to fill all the details in registration form.
- User need to pay Rs 500 as a registration fee then user will be registered successfully.
- Now, user will be provided with pass key (email+ 4digit random number)
- User has to remember the pass key.
- User can login to his/her account by clicking login (top right).
- User need to give there passkey inorder to see his/her profile.
- User can change his/her batch, delete account and pay fee from the profile page.
